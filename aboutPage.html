	<p class="header"> Y.O.U was created by three Kode with Klossy 2020 scholars. This website was created because amidst COVID-19, school, social justice issues, and so much more, we felt that it was important to take a step back and take some time out of the day for self-care. Many people's lives are filled with stress, anxiety, and pressure, so it is very important to practice self-care for mental and physical health. On this website, we compiled a variety of resources that can help relieve stress. You can journal, meditate, and find new music to help you relax!</p>
